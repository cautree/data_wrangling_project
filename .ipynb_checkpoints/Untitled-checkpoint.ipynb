    "1. Problems Encountered in the Map\n",
    "After downlowd the boston osm data, I run it against several python audit files, I noticed five main problems with the data, which I will discuss in the following order:\n",
    "● Street name format is not uniform, some are full name, some are simplified name\n",
    "● Inconsistent postal codes \n",
    "● Inconsistent city name format\n",
    "● Inconsistent state name format, and one mistake shows state of WA\n",
    "● Inconsistent country name format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistent street name \n",
    "By auditing the data using audit.py, I can see there is not a uniform format for street name,  and the street name are shown in various format. For example, the last word of the \"Street\" in the street name have this following format: \n",
    "            \"St,\" \n",
    "            \"St.\"        \n",
    "            \"Street.\" \n",
    "            \"street\"\n",
    "            \"St\" \n",
    "There are many other similar cases. I wrote a function in audit.py to unify the last word appeard in the street name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistant city name\n",
    "By auditing the data using audit_city.py, most the the city name shown up in the correct format, with the first letter of the city name capitizlised, and no state name is immediatly following the city name.    \n",
    "For example, for Cambridge city alone, there are three formats: “Cambridge”, “Cambridge, MA”, “Cambridge, Massachusetts”. I wrote a function in the audit_city.py to update the city format, such that all “Cambridge, MA” and “Cambridge, Massachusetts” become Cambridge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistant postal code\n",
    "By auditing the data using audit_zip.py, I can see there are two major format of postcode, one is 5-digit zip code, the other is 5-digit plus 4-digit extension. That is OK. But there are mistakes appeared in the postcode, for example, there is one special case where the zip code is only 4 digit, 0239, based on my knowledge, it should be 02139, I wrote a function in the audit_zip.py by mapping to correct the zip code accordingly. And there are several cases, the postcode is not a number, simply state name \"MA\", in this case, I changed the \"MA\" to \"N/A\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistant state name format\n",
    "By auditing the data using audit_state.py, I can see there are one major format of state name \"MA\", but there are various other kind of format, such as \n",
    "            \"Ma\",\n",
    "            \"ma\",\n",
    "            \"MA- MASSACHUSETTS\",            \n",
    "            \"MASSACHUSETTS\",\n",
    "            \"Massachusetts\"\n",
    "I wrote a function in audit_state.py to change the state into the uniform format \"MA\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Inconsistant country name format\n",
    "By auditing the data using audit_country.py, I can see there are two different major format of country name, one is \"US\", the other is \"USA\", since \"US\" has a greater percentage, I wrote a function in audit_country.py to change the country into the uniform format \"US\".\n",
